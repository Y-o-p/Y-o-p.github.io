Hi, I'm Jesse. Welcome to my portfolio website. Here, you'll find all my favorite projects I've developed over the years in reverse chronological order. Each project was developed independently unless otherwise stated.

## [ArchaicGE](https://github.com/Y-o-p/ArchaicGE): 3D Console Graphics
_May 2018 (Revisited May 2020)_

**ArchaicGE** is a raster graphics framework built with C# that displays 3D objects in the console. Different characters correspond to different light values. At this point, I had some experience with OpenGL but I wanted to learn more about the raster graphics pipeline.
